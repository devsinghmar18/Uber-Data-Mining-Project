# Uber-Data-Mining-Project


Background: Uber, a popular ride-hailing 
service, aims to provide reliable fare 
estimates to both passengers and drivers. 
However, accurately predicting fare and tip 
amounts for each trip remains a challenge 
due to various factors such as trip distance, 
number of passengers, tolls, and additional 
charges.

 Objective: The objective of this project is to 
develop robust predictive models to 
estimate fare amounts and tip amounts for 
Uber trips based on trip-related features.
